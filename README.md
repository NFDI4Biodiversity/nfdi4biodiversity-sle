## Description

The NFDI4Biodiversity Self-Study Unit (SSU) provides in-depth knowledge for both students and researchers specializing in biodiversity and environmental sciences. This learning is based on the online learning unit "Forschungsdatenmanagement - eine Online-Einführung (HeFDI Data Learning Materials)" of the Hessian Research Data Infrastructures. Developed in collaboration between several partners within NFDI4Biodiversity, the SSU offers essential domain-specific knowledge in research data management. 

- **Prerequisites**: No previous knowledge is required for this module. The chapters build on each other thematically, but can also be worked through individually. If information from other chapters is needed, they are linked.

- **Target audience**: students at PhD-level and beyond and researchers in the field of biology and environmental sciences, especially those working with biodiversity data, who are looking for a first introduction to research data management.

- **Learning objectives**: After completing this unit you will be able to understand the content and purpose of research data management and apply it in the field of biology. The detailed learning objectives are given at the beginning of each chapter.

The self-study unit undergoes periodic updates, responding to feedback from the community for continuous improvement. For inquiries or additional information, please feel free to reach out to us via our contact page: [NFDI4Biodiversity Contact](https://www.nfdi4biodiversity.org/de/kontakt/).
