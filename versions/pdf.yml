  NFDI4Biodiversity Self-Study Unit - Research Data Management for Biodiversity
  Data
description: >-
  The NFDI4Biodiversity Self-Study Unit (SSU) provides in-depth knowledge for
  both students and researchers specializing in biodiversity and environmental
  sciences. This learning is based on the online learning unit
  "Forschungsdatenmanagement - eine Online-Einführung (HeFDI Data Learning
  Materials)" (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6373596) of the Hessian Research
  Data Infrastructures. Developed in collaboration between several partners
  within NFDI4Biodiversity, the SSU offers essential domain-specific knowledge
  in research data management. 


  Prerequisites: No previous knowledge is required for this module. The chapters
  build on each other thematically, but can also be worked through individually.
  If information from other chapters is needed, they are linked.


  Target audience: students at PhD-level and beyond and researchers in the field
  of biology and environmental sciences, especially those working with
  biodiversity data, who are looking for a first introduction to research data
  management.


  Learning objectives: After completing this unit you will be able to understand
  the content and purpose of research data management and apply it in the field
  of biology. The detailed learning objectives are given at the beginning of
  each chapter.


  The self-study unit undergoes periodic updates, responding to feedback from
  the community for continuous improvement. For inquiries or additional
  information, please feel free to reach out to us via our contact page:
