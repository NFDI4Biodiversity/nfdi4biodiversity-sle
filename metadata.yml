  NFDI4Biodiversity Self-Paced Online Course - Research Data Management for
  Biodiversity Data
description: >-
  This self-paced online course developed by NFDI4Biodiversity provides in-depth
  knowledge for both students and researchers specializing in biodiversity and
  environmental sciences. This course is based on the online course
  Selbstlerneinheit Forschungsdatenmanagement - eine Online-Einführung (HeFDI
  Data Learning Materials,
  https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_1730142&client_id=UNIMR) of
  the Hessian Research Data Infrastructures (HeFDI,
  https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/hefdi). Developed in collaboration between
  several partners within NFDI4Biodiversity, this course offers essential
  domain-specific knowledge in research data management.

  Prerequisites: No previous knowledge is required for this module. The chapters
  build on each other thematically, but can also be worked through individually.
  If information from other chapters is needed, they are linked.

  Target audience: Master and PhD students and researchers in the field of
  biology and environmental sciences, especially those working with biodiversity
  data, who are looking for a first introduction to research data management.

  Learning objectives: After completing this unit you will be able to understand
  the content and purpose of research data management and apply it in the field
  of biology. Learning objectives are given at the beginning of each chapter.

  This course will be updated regularly, responding to feedback from the
  community for continuous improvement. For inquiries or additional information,
  please feel free to reach out to us by opening an issue or via our contact
